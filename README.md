# Big Round Band music

This is a working copy of the music for the Cambridge (UK)-based "Big Round Band".

This is mainly reconstructed from http://round.soc.srcf.net/band, with a hacky Makefile to help build the pdfs, and a few tweaks
to work with the newest version of abcm2ps.

## Pre-requisites

The Makefile requires:
 - abcm2ps (tested with abcm2ps-8.13.18 (2017-12-21) )
 - ps2pdf (from ghostscript)
 - sed (should be present on most Unix-like operating systems, including Mac OS X)
